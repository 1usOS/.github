## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### 1usOS is currently in development, if you are interested in contributing and collaborating, simply open an issue.

### What is 1usOS?
1usOS is a project that aims to build a next-generation user experience for computers (as well as mobile devices), it offers features such as:
- Remote Accessibility via Web Desktop
- Customizable Desktop Environment
- Running Containers and Subsystems
- Running Native and Non-Native (Windows, Android, etc) Games and Software
- Running Virtual Machines via QEMU/KVM
- Sharing Files and Media cross-platforms (including Windows, Android, iOS, macOS, TV, Linux, etc)
- 'Build Your Own OS' - Tailor-made Experience allowing users to select/install only the feature they want, from a minimal server environment to a feature-rich complete desktop
- No bloatware, we let users install only what they want

### Supported Devices
1usOS can be installed on any UEFI-based PCs running `x86_64` or `aarch64` and some SBCs (Single Board Computer) such as Raspberry Pi, Radxa Rock 5, Orange Pi, etc.

### Will you support RISC-V?
Arch Linux currently supports `x86_64` only, both Arch Linux RISC-V and Arch Linux ARM are unofficial projects, @kwankiu, the owner of this project, has been maintaining serval aarch64 SBCs making 1usOS available for `aarch64`, it is time-consuming and hard to maintain multiple architectures, therefore, 1usOS is unlikely to support RISC-V before Arch Linux officially supports `risc-v`.

### Where can I get 1usOS?
1usOS is currently in development, it is not yet available for download. You may join [our discord](https://discord.gg/jJDcp4qswV) to keep track of the progress.
